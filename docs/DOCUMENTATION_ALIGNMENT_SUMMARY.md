# Documentation Alignment Summary
## Complete Paradigm-to-Code Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Status:** ✅ ALIGNED - All documents updated to reflect complete vision

## Overview

All core documentation has been updated to reflect the complete 10-layer paradigm-to-code pipeline with bidirectional provenance tracking and absolute symmetry enforcement between business intent and implementation.

## Documentation Updates Applied

### ✅ VISION.md - Complete Pipeline Vision
**Updated Sections:**
- **One-liner**: Now emphasizes complete paradigm-to-code flow with bidirectional provenance
- **Problem & JTBD**: Enhanced to include paradigm frameworks, symmetry requirements, and zero dead code goal
- **Core Workflow**: Expanded to 10-layer system from idea → paradigm → context → documents → specs → code → tests → runtime
- **Value Proposition**: Added "Complete Provenance & Symmetry System" with unified graph architecture
- **MVP Scope**: Restructured into 5 phases showing current implementation status and planned capabilities

**Key Additions:**
- Paradigm selection as foundational layer (YC, McKinsey, Lean, Design Thinking)
- Bidirectional impact analysis (function changes show upstream PRD/vision effects)
- No orphan code rule with CI enforcement
- Runtime telemetry closure proving requirement satisfaction

### ✅ PRD.md - Extended Requirements
**Updated Sections:**
- **Functional Requirements**: Added 8 new requirements (R-PRD-016 through R-PRD-023) covering:
  - Paradigm engine with framework-specific questions
  - Spec & schema generation (REQ/NFR YAML files)
  - Code artifact graph with dependency tracking
  - Provenance headers linking all code to requirements
  - Traceability matrix auto-generation
  - Impact analysis showing change effects
  - Test layer tagging (unit/integration/E2E/NFR)
  - Runtime telemetry with requirement tagging

**API Endpoints**: Extended with complete paradigm-to-code API covering paradigm selection, spec generation, code generation, traceability matrix, impact analysis, and runtime validation

### ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md - SE Pipeline Integration
**Updated Sections:**
- **Context & Constraints**: Added paradigm-to-code architecture, SE pipeline integration, unified graph system, and symmetry enforcement
- **Components**: Added Paradigm Engine, Entity Extractor, Research Expander, Graph Integration Service, Code Generation Engine, Provenance Tracker, SE Integration Service, MVP Optimizer

**Key Architecture Changes:**
- Unified graph connecting all artifacts from idea entities to runtime telemetry
- CI gates preventing orphan code and misaligned tests
- Template-driven paradigm configurations
- Complete traceability from vision to functions

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - SE Pipeline Tasks
**Added Sections:**
- **SE Pipeline Tasks**: 12 new tasks (SE-001 through SE-012) covering:
  - Paradigm engine implementation
  - Entity extraction and research expansion (completed)
  - Graph integration service (completed)
  - Spec generation from PRDs
  - Code generation with provenance headers
  - Bidirectional provenance tracking
  - Traceability matrix automation
  - Impact analysis and change propagation
  - Test layer tagging and coverage
  - MVP optimizer (completed)
  - Runtime telemetry integration

**Status Overview**: 4 tasks completed, 8 planned for next phase

### ✅ SE_PIPELINE_SCHEMA.md - Complete Data Model
**Updated Sections:**
- **Entity Relationships**: Added PARADIGM, SPECIFICATION, CODE_ARTIFACT, TEST_ARTIFACT, and TELEMETRY_TAG entities
- **Layered Pipeline**: Updated flow to show all 10 layers from idea input through runtime observability
- **Entity Hierarchy**: Added Spec Layer entities (REQ/NFR YAML, API schemas) between PRD and Architecture
- **Provenance Chains**: Complete relationship mapping from paradigm → entity → spec → code → test → runtime

### ✅ UI_WIREFRAME_SCHEMA.md - Provenance Visualization
**Added Sections:**
- **Change Impact View**: GitHub-style interface showing upstream (requirements/docs) and downstream (tests/specs/runtime) effects of code changes
- **Traceability Matrix View**: Spreadsheet-style requirements coverage with orphan code detection
- **Runtime Telemetry Dashboard**: Production requirement validation showing SLO compliance and evidence

### ✅ DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md - Complete File Organization
**New Document Created:**
- **Project Structure**: 8 main directories covering paradigm → context → docs → specs → src → tests → traceability → governance → observability
- **File Naming Conventions**: Standardized ID patterns (REQ-*, NFR-*, FRS-*, T-*, UC-*, ADR-*)
- **Provenance Headers**: Template for code and test files with complete traceability
- **CI/CD Gates**: 5 symmetry enforcement rules preventing orphan code and misalignment
- **Examples**: Complete REQ file and code file examples showing provenance implementation

## System Capabilities Now Documented

### ✅ Complete Paradigm Support
- YC Startup framework with market-first questions
- McKinsey Problem-Solving with structured analysis
- Lean Startup with hypothesis-driven development
- Design Thinking with user-centered approach

### ✅ Bidirectional Provenance Tracking
- Every code artifact links to requirements (IMPLEMENTS headers)
- Every requirement links to implementing code
- Change impact analysis shows all affected components
- Traceability matrix provides universal alignment index

### ✅ Absolute Symmetry Enforcement
- CI gates prevent orphan code (every file needs REQ tag)
- Test coverage requirements (every implementation needs verification)
- Spec alignment validation (every API matches OpenAPI schema)
- Runtime validation (telemetry proves requirement satisfaction)

### ✅ Multi-Layer Integration
- Idea entities flow through all 10 layers
- Research expansion enriches context at every stage
- Council debates generate consensus with human oversight
- MVP optimizer ensures resource-constrained feasibility

## Next Steps

The documentation is now fully aligned with the complete paradigm-to-code vision. The system supports:

1. **Complete Pipeline**: Idea → Paradigm → Context → Docs → Specs → Code → Tests → Runtime
2. **Bidirectional Provenance**: Function changes show impact on vision/PRD, requirement changes show affected code
3. **Absolute Symmetry**: Zero orphan code, perfect test alignment, complete requirement coverage
4. **Framework Flexibility**: Support for multiple development paradigms with specific question sets
5. **Research Integration**: Automatic context expansion with market/industry/competition data
6. **Runtime Closure**: Production telemetry proving requirement satisfaction

All documents are now consistent and ready for implementation of the remaining SE pipeline components.
