# LLM Council: Idea Operating System

**Owner:** Erik Cohen  
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Status:** âœ… MVP Validated - Ready for Development

## The Problem

Founders and teams struggle to turn raw ideas into production-ready software. They waste time building the wrong thing, requirements drift from original vision, and code loses connection to business goals.

## The Vision

**Transform any idea into working software with complete traceability from vision to code.**

Choose proven frameworks (YC, McKinsey, Lean), let AI + research expand your understanding, then generate documents â†’ specs â†’ code with every change tracked from business intent to implementation.

## Who This Serves

- **Founders**: Structure your idea with proven frameworks, understand your market
- **Product Managers**: Generate requirements that stay aligned with vision
- **Engineers**: Build from clear specs with complete provenance
- **Teams**: Track how any change impacts the entire system

## The Experience

1. **Start with any idea** â†’ Select a framework (YC, McKinsey, Lean)
2. **Answer guided questions** â†’ AI research fills gaps, human adds context
3. **Generate living documents** â†’ Vision â†’ PRD â†’ Architecture â†’ Implementation Plan
4. **Council reviews & validates** â†’ Multi-LLM auditors + human oversight
5. **Code flows from specs** â†’ Every function traces back to requirements
6. **Changes show impact** â†’ Edit anything, see what it affects across docs/code/tests

## What Makes This Different

- **Proven Frameworks**: Built on YC, McKinsey, Lean principles - not generic templates
- **AI + Human Intelligence**: LLM research + human strategic judgment
- **Complete Traceability**: Every code change traces back to original business intent
- **Multi-Model Council**: Different AI models audit different aspects for better decisions

## Current Status

### âœ… MVP Foundation (Validated)
- **Core Data Models**: Problem, ICP, Assumption entities working
- **Schema Validation**: Complete validation system for auditor responses
- **Service Architecture**: Basic service interfaces and initialization
- **Basic Workflows**: Founder journey from idea to structured entities
- **Validation Framework**: 13/13 tests passing with comprehensive coverage

### ðŸ”„ Building Now
- **Neo4j Integration**: Database operations for entity storage
- **Council Debate System**: Multi-LLM debate functionality
- **Question Generation**: Paradigm-specific question generation
- **Research Integration**: Tavily API for context expansion

### ðŸ”® Planned Next
- **Web UI**: React frontend with real-time updates
- **Complete Provenance**: Full traceability from vision to runtime
- **Advanced E2E Tests**: Complex user journey validation

## Success Metrics

### Current Targets (MVP)
- **Time to Value**: Raw idea â†’ validated documents â‰¤15 min
- **Quality**: Human override rate â‰¤20%
- **Cost**: â‰¤$2 per complete idea â†’ code transformation
- **System Readiness**: 100% (achieved âœ…)

### Future Targets (Full Platform)
- **Traceability**: 100% code coverage with requirement links
- **Impact Analysis**: â‰¤30 sec to show change propagation
- **Requirements Coverage**: â‰¥90% of REQ-XXX have implementing code
- **Test Coverage**: â‰¥80% of source files have corresponding tests

## Architecture Overview

```
Idea Input â†’ Entity Extraction â†’ Question Generation â†’ Council Debate â†’ Consensus â†’ Document Generation â†’ Code Generation â†’ Provenance Tracking
```

**Core Components:**
- **Multi-Model Council**: GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini with specialized roles
- **Paradigm Engine**: YC, McKinsey, Lean framework support
- **Research Agent**: Tavily integration for market context
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for entity relationships and provenance
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive test coverage ensuring quality

## Getting Started

### Quick Validation

# Verify system is working
python3 scripts/run-basic-validation.py --verbose
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run smoke tests
python3 scripts/smoke-test.py --verbose

# Start development
# (See README.md for detailed setup)
```
