# VISION.md â€” LLM Council: Idea Operating System

**Owner:** Erik Cohen  
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Status:** High-Level Vision

## The Problem

Founders and teams struggle to turn raw ideas into production-ready software. They waste time building the wrong thing, requirements drift from original vision, and code loses connection to business goals.

## The Vision

**Transform any idea into working software with complete traceability from vision to code.**

Choose proven frameworks (YC, McKinsey, Lean), let AI + research expand your understanding, then generate documents â†’ specs â†’ code with every change tracked from business intent to implementation.

## Who This Serves

**Founders**: Structure your idea with proven frameworks, understand your market  
**Product Managers**: Generate requirements that stay aligned with vision  
**Engineers**: Build from clear specs with complete provenance  
**Teams**: Track how any change impacts the entire system

## The Experience

1. **Start with any idea** â†’ Select a framework (YC, McKinsey, Lean)
2. **Answer guided questions** â†’ AI research fills gaps, human adds context  
3. **Generate living documents** â†’ Vision â†’ PRD â†’ Architecture â†’ Implementation Plan
4. **Council reviews & validates** â†’ Multi-LLM auditors + human oversight
5. **Code flows from specs** â†’ Every function traces back to requirements
6. **Changes show impact** â†’ Edit anything, see what it affects across docs/code/tests

## What Makes This Different

**Proven Frameworks**: Built on YC, McKinsey, Lean principles - not generic templates  
**AI + Human Intelligence**: LLM research + human strategic judgment  
**Complete Traceability**: Every code change traces back to original business intent  
**Multi-Model Council**: Different AI models audit different aspects for better decisions  

## Current Status

**âœ… MVP Ready**: Core council system with document generation  
**ðŸ”„ Building**: Full paradigm platform with research integration  
**ðŸ”® Planned**: Complete provenance from vision to runtime observability

See detailed requirements in:
- [PRD_MVP.md](./PRD_MVP.md) - Core council system
- [PRD_PLATFORM.md](./PRD_PLATFORM.md) - Paradigm-driven development  
- [PRD_PROVENANCE.md](./PRD_PROVENANCE.md) - Complete traceability

## Success Metrics

**Time to Value**: Raw idea â†’ validated documents â‰¤15 min  
**Quality**: Human override rate â‰¤20% (high AI + research accuracy)  
**Cost**: â‰¤$2 per complete idea â†’ code transformation  
**Traceability**: 100% code coverage with requirement links
- **Impact Analysis**: â‰¤30 sec to show change propagation across entire pipeline

### **Quality & Alignment:**
- **Requirements Coverage**: â‰¥90% of REQ-XXX have implementing code
- **Test Coverage**: â‰¥80% of source files have corresponding tests  
- **Provenance Completeness**: 100% of generated code has traceable requirements
- **Drift Detection**: â‰¤5% drift score between specs and implementation

### **Cost & Reliability:**
- **Total Cost**: â‰¤$3/run including research, council debates, and code generation
- **Cache Hit Rate**: â‰¥70% for iterative development cycles
- **JSON Validity**: â‰¥99% with automatic retry logic

## 7) Constraints & assumptions

- Python CLI; OpenAI (swap-able); optional LangGraph spine later.
- Docs are markdown; no PII expected.
- Local file outputs, no DB required.

## 8) Cross-cutting notes (brief)

- **Security/Privacy:** keys via env; local artifacts; no PII expected.
- **Usability:** one command, clear outputs; readable `audit.md`.
- **Maintainability:** small modules; YAML config; tests.
- **Scalability:** parallel auditors; chunking if needed.
- **Viability/Cost:** caching + max call caps; small default council.
- **Evaluation/Obs:** per-auditor JSON; counters for cost/time.

## 9) Risks & open questions

- Model drift â†’ enforce JSON schema, retries.
- Duplicate findings â†’ simple dedupe + rank.
- Thin alignment heuristics â†’ expand after MVP.

### Gate checklist (Vision â†’ PRD)

- [ ] Quantified success metrics set.
- [ ] MVP scope explicit (3â€“5 bullets).
- [ ] Research step included.
- [ ] 0 **CRITICAL**, â‰¤2 **HIGH** open issues.
