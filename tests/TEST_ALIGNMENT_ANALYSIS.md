## ❌ **MISSING TESTS - Critical Gaps:**

### 1. **Paradigm Engine Tests (SE-001)**
```python
# tests/test_paradigm_engine.py - MISSING
# VERIFIES: R-PRD-016 (paradigm framework selection)
# SHOULD TEST:
# - YC framework question generation
# - McKinsey problem-solving flow  
# - Lean Startup hypothesis validation
# - Design Thinking user-centered questions
# - Framework switching and question adaptation
```

### 2. **SE Integration Service Tests (SE-002)**
```python
# tests/test_se_integration.py - MISSING  
# VERIFIES: Pipeline integration requirements
# SHOULD TEST:
# - Complete 10-layer pipeline orchestration
# - Layer-to-layer data flow validation
# - Error handling between pipeline stages
# - Rollback and recovery mechanisms
```

### 3. **MVP Optimizer Tests (SE-003)**
```python
# tests/test_mvp_optimizer.py - MISSING
# VERIFIES: Resource optimization and scope planning
# SHOULD TEST:
# - WSJF scoring and prioritization
# - Budget constraint enforcement
# - Feature cut-line optimization
# - Resource allocation validation
```

### 4. **Complete User Workflow Tests (UC-001 through UC-010)**
```python
# tests/integration/test_user_workflows.py - MISSING
# VERIFIES: Complete end-to-end user journeys
# SHOULD TEST:
# - UC-001: Idea → Vision (paradigm selection through consensus)
# - UC-002: Vision → PRD (requirements generation with human input)
# - UC-003: PRD → Architecture (component design with council debate)
# - UC-004: Architecture → Implementation (task breakdown)
# - UC-005: Implementation → Code Generation (stub creation with provenance)
# - UC-006: Code Change → Impact Analysis (bidirectional propagation)
# - UC-007: Requirement Change → Affected Code Detection
# - UC-008: Test Generation → Coverage Validation
# - UC-009: Traceability Matrix → Orphan Detection
# - UC-010: Runtime Telemetry → Requirement Validation
```

### 5. **Spec Generation Tests (SE-004)**

# SHOULD TEST:

# - NFR extraction and YAML formatting
# - OpenAPI schema generation from interfaces
# - JSON-Schema creation from data models
```

## Test Naming Convention Gaps

### ❌ **MISSING REQ/FRS/UC TAGGING:**

Current tests lack provenance headers linking to requirements:

```python
# CURRENT (inadequate):
def test_consensus_algorithm():
    pass

# REQUIRED (with provenance):
def test_consensus_algorithm():
    """
    VERIFIES: REQ-004 (consensus engine thresholds)
    VALIDATES: Trimmed mean algorithm with agreement detection
    USE_CASE: UC-003 (PRD → Architecture consensus building)
    INTERFACES: N/A
    LAST_SYNC: 2025-08-30
    """
    pass
```

## Step-by-Step User Workflow Test Requirements

Based on updated documentation, tests must validate these **complete user journeys**:

### **Journey 1: Idea → Vision (R-PRD-016)**
```python
def test_complete_idea_to_vision_workflow():
    """
    VERIFIES: R-PRD-016 (paradigm engine), UC-001 (idea to vision)
    SCENARIO: User inputs idea → selects YC framework → answers questions → generates vision
    """
    # 1. User inputs: "Build a water tracking app for health-conscious users"
    # 2. System presents paradigm options: YC, McKinsey, Lean, Design Thinking
    # 3. User selects YC framework
    # 4. System generates YC-specific questions about market, problem, solution
    # 5. User answers questions with LLM assistance
    # 6. Research agent expands context with market data
    # 7. Council debates and reaches vision consensus
    # 8. System generates VISION.md with complete traceability
```

### **Journey 2: Vision → Code → Runtime (R-PRD-017 through R-PRD-023)**
```python
def test_complete_vision_to_runtime_workflow():
    """
    VERIFIES: R-PRD-017→R-PRD-023 (complete pipeline)
    SCENARIO: Vision document → PRD → specs → code → tests → runtime telemetry
    """
    # 1. Load VISION.md → extract requirements
    # 2. Generate PRD.md with hierarchical FRS-XXX requirements
    # 3. Create REQ-*.yaml and NFR-*.yaml specifications
    # 4. Generate code stubs with provenance headers
    # 5. Create test files tagged to requirements/interfaces/use-cases
    # 6. Build traceability matrix showing complete coverage
    # 7. Simulate runtime telemetry tagged with REQ/Component IDs
    # 8. Validate end-to-end requirement satisfaction
```

### **Journey 3: Change Impact Propagation (R-PRD-021)**
```python
def test_bidirectional_change_impact_workflow():
    """
    VERIFIES: R-PRD-021 (impact analysis), UC-006 (change propagation)
    SCENARIO: Code change → upstream PRD impacts + downstream test effects
    """
    # 1. Modify function in auth_service.py (add rate limiting)
    # 2. System detects change and analyzes provenance chain
    # 3. Shows upstream impacts: REQ-AUTH-001, PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
    # 4. Shows downstream impacts: test files, API specs, telemetry tags
    # 5. Generates recommended updates for affected artifacts
    # 6. Validates symmetry maintenance across all layers
```

## Missing Test Categories by Layer

- ✅ Code generation engine (implemented)
- ✅ Provenance tracking (implemented)
- ❌ Test file generation with tagging (missing)

### **Layer 7-8: Traceability & Impact (Partial Tests)**

## Critical Missing Integration Tests

```python
# tests/integration/test_complete_pipeline.py - MISSING
def test_end_to_end_paradigm_to_runtime_pipeline():
    """Complete pipeline test from idea input to runtime validation."""
    
def test_requirement_change_propagation():
    """Test requirement change impacts across all layers."""
    
def test_code_change_upstream_impact():
    """Test code change showing PRD/vision impacts."""
    
def test_traceability_matrix_accuracy():
    """Validate traceability matrix completeness."""
    
def test_orphan_code_detection():
    """Test detection of code without requirement links."""
```

## Recommended Actions

1. **Create missing test files** for paradigm engine, SE integration, MVP optimizer
2. **Add provenance headers** to all existing tests with REQ/FRS/UC tags
3. **Create integration test suite** for complete user workflows (UC-001→UC-010)
4. **Update test naming** to follow provenance conventions
5. **Add missing layer coverage** for spec generation, runtime telemetry, governance
6. **Create traceability validation** ensuring tests cover all requirements

Current test coverage: **~60%** of complete pipeline
Target coverage: **90%** with complete user workflow validation
