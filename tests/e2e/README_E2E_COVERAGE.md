```

### Running E2E Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/e2e/ -v

# Run specific user journey
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/e2e/test_founder_journey.py -v

## Quality Gates

Each E2E test enforces quality gates:

1. **Data Consistency**: All operations maintain graph integrity
2. **Provenance Completeness**: 100% traceability from idea to code
3. **User Experience**: Each user type achieves defined success criteria
4. **System Integration**: Cross-component operations work seamlessly
5. **Performance**: Operations complete within target timeframes
6. **Error Handling**: Failure scenarios handled gracefully

## Continuous Validation

The E2E tests serve as:
- **Regression Prevention**: Any changes that break user journeys fail CI
- **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark validation on every release
- **Integration Validation**: Cross-service communication verified
- **User Experience Validation**: Complete workflows tested end-to-end
- **Business Logic Validation**: Paradigm frameworks work as intended

## Next Steps

2. **Load Testing**: Stress test with 100+ concurrent users
3. **API Contract Testing**: OpenAPI compliance validation
4. **Security Testing**: End-to-end security and compliance validation
5. **Data Migration Testing**: Validate system upgrades preserve provenance
